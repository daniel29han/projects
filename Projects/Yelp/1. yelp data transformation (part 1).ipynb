    "**1. Data Acquisition:** Several datasets available in json format were downloaded from the Yelp website. This project was exectued on these datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Transformation & Cleaning:** The obtained raw datasets were converted to a comma-separated values (csv) format, combined, transformed, and wrangled using Python and its libraries into a cleaner dataset, i.e., data wireframe, ready for  analysis. The Pandas and Numpy libraries were used throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key findings on the attributes of most-liked businesses and the consumer behahaviours are reported. Feature engineering was performed in this process to create other meaningful variables. Several noticeable patterns were illustrated using the visualization libraries in Python, including the Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly libraries. \n",
